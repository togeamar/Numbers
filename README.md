numbers guessing android game

This android game can be played with 2 to 4 players.
first each player needs to choose a number from 1 to 20 and not tell that number to other players and then every palyer will iteratively guess numbers.
the catch here is that the players should not guess other players numbers and cant enter his own number.
if player enters a number chosen by other player that other player will be safe.
the last player who will not be safe will lose the the game.
